-Hi, I’m @LucasP0326.  My name is Lucas Sanchez.

-My interests lie in video game design, specifically, narrative design.  I love crafting stories that others can interact with and experience as though they themselves were a part of it,

-I am currently a graduate student at UCF's Digital Media program pursuing a master's in game design while also working as a graduate teacher associate, running our lab and assisting in teaching classes.

-If you wish to reach out to me reason, you can do so at my email: 200lucassanchez@gmail.com, and from there, we can possibly communicate via some other platform.
